<h1>F5 SSL VPN</h1>

<p>Experimental support for <a
href="https://www.f5.com/services/resources/glossary/ssl-vpn">F5 SSL
VPN</a> was added to OpenConnect in March 2021. It is also known as BIG-IP in
some documentation. It is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol">PPP</a>-based
protocol using the native PPP support which was merged into the 9.00
release.</p>

<p>F5 mode is requested by adding <tt>--protocol=f5</tt>
to the command line:
<pre>
  openconnect --protocol=f5 big-ip.example.com
</pre></p>

<p>Since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230228035749/https://sites.inka.de/~W1011/devel/tcp-tcp.html">TCP over
TCP is very suboptimal</a>, OpenConnect tries to always use PPP-over-DTLS,
and will only fall over to the PPP-over-TLS tunnel if that fails, or if
disabled via the <tt>--no-dtls</tt> argument.</p>

<h2>Quirks and Issues</h2>

<p>Currently, OpenConnect should fully support basic username/password
authentication for F5, along with an optional TLS client certificate
and the "domain" dropdown used by some F5 VPNs. The domain form field
can be automatically populated with the <tt>--authgroup</tt> command-line option.</p>

<p>Like <a href="juniper.html">Juniper</a>, the F5 VPN expects a full
web browser environment for authentication, and uses HTML forms which
rely heavily on JavaScript.  In some cases, JavaScript is used to
inject modified values into hidden form fields, without which
authentication will not complete successfully. If, as in <a
href="https://gitlab.com/openconnect/openconnect/-/issues/493#note_1098089413">#493</a>,
your F5 VPN uses a hidden form field with a value that must be
overridden, you may be able to work around this by running
<tt>openconnect --protocol=f5 <a
href="manual.html#opt-form-entry">--form-entry</a>="hidden_form:choice=1"</tt>
or similar (see issue for details on how this was determined).</p>

<p>If you have access to an F5 VPN which uses other types of authentication (e.g.
RSA or OATH tokens), please send information to <a href="mail.html">the mailing
list</a> so that we add support to OpenConnect.</p>

<h3>DTLS</h3>

<p>Connectivity over DTLS is supported. On BIG-IP server v16, it is possible to use
either DTLSv1.0 or DTLSv1.2, if configured correctly. On BIG-IP server v15, it is limited to
DTLSv1.0 because experiments show that BIG-IP server v15 cannot negotiate correctly down to
DTLSv1.0 when a newer version of DTLS is attempted.</p>

<h3>Interpreting <tt>f5-vpn://</tt> URIs</h3>

<p>Some proprietary F5 VPN clients use a web-based front-end for authentication.
This authentication flow terminates in a URI that starts with <tt>f5-vpn://</tt>,
for which the proprietary F5 client is registered as a handler.</p>

<p>We do not yet understand how to interpret these URIs in a way that is sufficient to
allow OpenConnect to use them to establish a connection. See
<a href="https://gitlab.com/openconnect/openconnect/-/issues/639">GitLab issue #639</a> and
<a href="https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/openconnect-devel/2021-August/005035.html">this
August 2021 discussion</a> on <a href="mail.html">the mailing list</a>. Please contribute if
you have information that can help us understand how to use these URIs.</p>
